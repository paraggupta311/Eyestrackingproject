Eyes Tracking :-     
My major application, named "EyeTrack," employed Mediapipe and OpenCV for real-time eye tracking.

Functionality:
EyeTrack detected and tracked the movement of a person's eyes in real-time using a computer's camera.

Inputs:
Video feed from a camera capturing the user's face.
Real-time image frames for eye detection.

Outputs:
Real-time display of the detected eyes.
Eye movement tracking coordinates.

Tech Stack:
Mediapipe for facial landmark detection.
OpenCV for image processing and visualization.

Main Challenges:
Accuracy: Ensuring precise eye tracking across varying lighting and head angles.
Real-Time Processing: Achieving low-latency eye tracking to provide real-time feedback.
User Interface: Designing a simple and intuitive interface to visualize eye movement.
Hardware Compatibility: Ensuring the application worked on a variety of camera setups.
Calibration: Implementing an accurate calibration process for different users.
EyeTrack demonstrated the potential of computer vision technologies in applications like gaze tracking, with applications in fields such as human-computer interaction and accessibility.
